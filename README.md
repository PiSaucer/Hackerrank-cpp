# Hackerrank (C++ Version)

This repo holds the hacker rank assignments that I have completed with their directions, test cases, and template solutions. THERE ARE NO ANSWERS in this repo, it just custom makefiles along with case tests to ensure the code passes. It has the assignments as the website, however, it works offline if you locally clone/fork it. I encourage you to download this repo locally to be able to run the make commands with ease.

# Fair Use

Copyright Disclaimer Under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.

Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing.

### Fair Use Definition

Fair use is a doctrine in United States copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders, such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching, or scholarship. It provides for the legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author’s work under a four-factor balancing test.
